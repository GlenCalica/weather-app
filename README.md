Weather App using JavaScript and OpenWeatherMap API.

**Important Note:** This will not work if you download it as you need your own API key from OpenWeatherMap. There's a note on the first line on app.js which tells you what to replace.

**Less Important Note:** I pushed code which had my API Key. I had to delete the repo and recreate it--which is why there's only a few commits 

## Overview
This is a weather app made using vanilla JavaScript and the OpenWeatherMap API. This is my first project using an API. The app will request to use the device's location and retrieve the weather based on the device's longitude and latitude. There's also an option to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Process
1. Create site using HTML
2. Make sure the site can retrieve data from the API using JavaScript
3. Style using CSS
4. Add functionality (such as converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit) using JavaScript

## Challenges
I've had to rely on a tutorial for retrieving data from the API, but everything after that is my own code. I also didn't know that you shouldn't release an API key on GitHub--but I'm glad I learned that through using this API and not something more serious.

## Next Time
If I were to do this project again, I would
- I wouldn't change anything drastic, but I would program more efficiently.

## Things to Add
If I were to add some things to this project, I would
-host the site on a website so I could show others a live example
